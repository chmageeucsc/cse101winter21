README has all the file names in one place.
Files include: List.cpp, List.h, ListTest.cpp, Shuffle.cpp, Makefile, and README
These files are for pa3.

There is an extra local function in Graph.c, visit(int x, int time, Graph G, List s), needed for DFS().
No global variables used for visit().
visit() has a parameter int time to keep track of discover time and finishing time.
visit() also has a parameter List s to access the List from DFS and append the finished vertices.

pa3's Graph.c and Graph.h were taken from pa2 and modified to fit the current assignment.
